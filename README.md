# ALX Backend Python

This repository contains projects and tasks for learning backend development in Python. It covers various topics, including variable annotations, asynchronous programming, and unit testing.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### [0x00-python_variable_annotations](0x00-python_variable_annotations/README.md)
This directory focuses on Python variable annotations, which improve code readability and enable static type checking.

Key topics:
- Type hints for variables, functions, and return types
- Using `typing` module for advanced type annotations
- Practical examples of type annotations

### [0x01-python_async_function](0x01-python_async_function/README.md)
This directory introduces asynchronous programming in Python using `async` and `await`.

Key topics:
- Writing asynchronous functions
- Using `asyncio` for concurrency
- Managing tasks and event loops

### [0x02-python_async_comprehension](0x02-python_async_comprehension/README.md)
This directory explores asynchronous comprehensions and generators.

Key topics:
- Using `async for` and `async with`
- Creating asynchronous generators
- Measuring runtime for asynchronous tasks

### [0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests](0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests/README.md)
This directory focuses on writing unit tests and integration tests in Python.

Key topics:
- Using `unittest` for testing
- Mocking with `unittest.mock`
- Parameterized tests with `parameterized`
- Integration testing with fixtures

## Prerequisites

To work with this repository, you need:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with Git for version control

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-backend-python.git
   cd alx-backend-python
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running Code

Navigate to the desired directory and execute the Python scripts. For example:
```sh
cd 0x01-python_async_function
python3 0-main.py
```

## Testing

Unit tests are provided for most tasks. To run the tests:
```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s 0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests
```
